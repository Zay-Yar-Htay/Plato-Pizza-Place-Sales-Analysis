## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Plato Pizza Place, a fictitious pizza restaurant, to gain insights into customer behavior, order composition, revenue trends, and menu optimization. The dataset, provided by Maven Analytics, includes records of all orders placed over a year, detailing the date and time of each order, the pizzas served, and additional information on pizza types, sizes, prices, and ingredients.

The dataset comprises four key tables:

* Order Details: The fact table, which provides a breakdown of each order, including the pizza ID, quantity, and order details ID, with a total of 48,260 records.
* Orders: A dimension table that contains details of each order, including the order ID, date, and time.
* Pizzas: A dimension table that lists the pizza ID, type, size, and price.
* Pizza Types: A sub-dimension table of the Pizzas table, which describes the pizza types, including the name, category, and ingredients.

This project aimed to provide actionable insights that could guide Plato Pizza Place's strategic decisions, from optimizing the menu to enhancing customer engagement. The analysis focused on understanding daily customer traffic, identifying peak hours, determining bestselling and underperforming pizzas, and assessing revenue patterns to uncover potential seasonality in sales.
